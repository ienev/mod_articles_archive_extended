Archived Articles - Extended
============================

This is modification of the original Joomla! Archived Articles module. It shows a list of the calendar months containing Articles. Users can choose the state of the articles - Archived, Published or both as well as the Category of the articles.

WARNING! This module will only work with the plg_system_layout plugin which overrides the com_content Archive view.
